# Gen-AI-Using-Langchain

🚀 A hands-on learning journey into **Generative AI** using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) — a powerful Python framework for building applications with LLMs (Large Language Models).  

This repository contains **codes, notebooks, and documents** I created while following the **CampusX tutorial playlist** on Generative AI with LangChain:
