# ðŸ“˜ LangChain: Main Components

## ðŸ”¹ What is LangChain?
**LangChain** is a **model-agnostic framework** for building applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)**.  
It is designed to work with different LLMs, embeddings, vector databases, and cloud providers â€” allowing you to swap components without rewriting your whole app.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Main Components of LangChain

LangChain has **6 core components** that help you build advanced AI applications.

---

### 1. Models
**Models** are the core interface for interacting with AI.

- **Purpose:** Standardizes how you communicate with any AI model.
- **Types of Models:**
  - **Language Models (LLMs):** Text-to-text (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face)
  - **Embedding Models:** Text-to-vector (e.g., OpenAI, MistralAI, IBM, Ollama)
  
> Think of models as the "brains" of your application.

---

### 2. Prompts
A **prompt** is the text you send to an LLM as input.

- **Importance:** Small changes can drastically change the output.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Dynamic & reusable prompts
  - Rule-based prompts
  - Few-shot prompting

> Prompts are like instructions for your AI to follow.

---

### 3. Chains
**Chains** help you build **pipelines** for AI workflows.

- **Function:** Control how information flows between models, tools, and components.
- **Features:**
  - Automatic passing of outputs to the next stage
  - Support for complex pipelines:
    - Parallel chains
    - Conditional chains

> Chains are like connecting Lego blocks of AI logic.

---

### 4. Indexes
**Indexes** connect your app to **external knowledge sources** like PDFs, websites, or databases.

- **Components of an Index:**
  1. Document Loader
  2. Text Splitter
  3. Vector Store
  4. Retriever

> Indexes allow your AI to "read" and understand your data.

---

### 5. Memory
**Memory** lets your AI "remember" past interactions.

- **Why:** LLM API calls are stateless by default.
- **Types of Memory:**
  1. **ConversationBufferMemory** â€“ Stores all recent messages
  2. **ConversationBufferWindowMemory** â€“ Keeps only the last N interactions
  3. **Summarized-Based Memory** â€“ Summarizes older chats for efficiency
  4. **Custom Memory** â€“ Store specialized states (e.g., user preferences)

> Memory makes your AI more **context-aware** and personal.

---

### 6. Agents
**Agents** are AI programs that can **reason and use tools**.

- **What sets them apart from chatbots:**
  1. Reasoning capabilities
  2. Ability to access tools for tasks

> Agents are like AI assistants that can think and act beyond simple chat.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use LangChain?
- Easily build **complex AI pipelines**  
- Swap models, databases, and tools without rewriting code  
- Create **conversational agents, AI knowledge workers, and workflow automation**

## ðŸ”¹ Alternatives to LangChain
- **LlamaIndex**  
- **Haystack**
