# 📘 LangChain & Semantic Search

## 🔹 What is LangChain?
**LangChain** is an open-source framework for developing applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)**.

## 🔹 What is Semantic Search?
Semantic search is a way of finding information based on **meaning** rather than exact keywords.  

Instead of just matching the words you typed, it tries to **understand the intent and context** of your query and then finds results that are conceptually similar — even if they use different wording.

## 🔹 How Semantic Search Works
1. **Convert text into vectors (Embeddings)**  
   Every document and your query are transformed into **numerical representations** that capture meaning.  
   > Example: *"car"* and *"automobile"* will have similar vector values, even though the words are different.

2. **Compare similarity**  
   The system measures how close the query vector is to each document vector using metrics like **cosine similarity**.  
   The closer they are, the more semantically relevant they are.

3. **Return ranked results**  
   Results are sorted by **meaning-match**, not just keyword overlap.

## 🔹 Why is Semantic Search Useful?
1. Handles **synonyms, paraphrasing, and varied vocabulary**.  
2. Works well for **chatbots, RAG systems, knowledge bases, and recommendation engines**.  
3. Especially important when searching through **unstructured text** (e.g., articles, transcripts, reviews).
