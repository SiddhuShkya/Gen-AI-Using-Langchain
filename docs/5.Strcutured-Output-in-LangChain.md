## ðŸ“˜ Structured Output in LangChain

## ðŸ”¹ What is Structured Output?

Structured output in LLMs refers to generating responses that follow a **predefined format or schema**, such as JSON, dictionaries, or custom data classes. Unlike free-form text, structured outputs are **machine-readable**, making them useful for downstream tasks like APIs, databases, or automation workflows. Python tools like **TypedDict** or **Pydantic** can define expected structures, and LangChain provides mechanisms to enforce structured outputs.

**Prompt:**

> Recommend movies if I like these five: Inception, The Dark Knight, Interstellar, The Prestige, and Memento.

**Unstructured Response (typical LLM output):**
Got it â€” since you enjoyed those five Nolan-style thrillers and sci-fi dramas, here are 3 solid recommendations:

Shutter Island â€“ A psychological thriller with mind-bending twists.

Fight Club â€“ Dark, layered storytelling with a focus on identity.

Blade Runner 2049 â€“ Stunning visuals and deep sci-fi world-building.

**Structured (JSON) Output:**

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "title": "Shutter Island",
      "reason": "Psychological thriller with mind-bending twists, similar to Nolanâ€™s style."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fight Club",
      "reason": "Dark, layered storytelling with themes of identity and reality."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blade Runner 2049",
      "reason": "Visually stunning sci-fi with philosophical depth, aligning with Interstellar and Inception vibes."
